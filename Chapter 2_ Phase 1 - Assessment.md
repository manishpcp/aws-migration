# Chapter 2: Phase 1 - Assessment

*The Foundation That Makes or Breaks Everything*

I'll never forget the moment during a board presentation when the CFO asked, "How do we know this cloud migration will actually save us money?" The room went silent. We'd spent three months planning architecture and selecting tools, but hadn't done the financial homework. That awkward silence cost us six months of delays and nearly killed the entire project.

**That was my last migration without a bulletproof assessment.**

Today, I start every client engagement with what I call "ruthless discovery"—a comprehensive assessment that leaves no server unturned, no dependency unmapped, and no assumption unchallenged. It's unglamorous work, but it's the difference between migration success and career-limiting disasters.

After leading assessments for over 200 enterprise migrations, I've learned that **the quality of your assessment directly predicts the success of your migration**. Get this phase right, and everything else flows smoothly. Skip corners here, and you'll pay for it in production outages, budget overruns, and sleepless nights.

***

## Current Environment Analysis: Digital Archaeology

Think of assessment like being a detective at a crime scene. You're not just cataloging evidence—you're reconstructing the story of how your IT environment evolved, understanding the relationships between systems, and identifying the smoking guns that could derail your migration.

### Conducting Workload Analysis and Application Inventory

**The Visible vs. The Invisible**

Most organizations think they know what they're running. After 15 years of assessments, I can tell you with certainty: **they're always wrong.**

I recently worked with a retail chain that swore they had "exactly 47 servers." Our discovery tools found 127 virtual machines, 23 physical servers they'd forgotten about, and a critical point-of-sale system running on a server in a store manager's office. Without comprehensive discovery, we would have migrated their e-commerce platform while accidentally leaving their payment processing behind.

**My Discovery Methodology:**

**Phase 1: Automated Discovery (Week 1-2)**

```bash
# Deploy AWS Application Discovery Service agents
aws discovery start-data-collection-by-agent-ids \
  --agent-ids "agent-12345" "agent-67890" "agent-11111"

# Configure agentless discovery for VMware environments
aws discovery create-application \
  --name "RetailEnvironmentDiscovery" \
  --description "Complete infrastructure mapping"

# Generate comprehensive inventory
aws discovery list-configurations \
  --configuration-type Server \
  --max-results 1000 > server-inventory.json

# Export discovery data for analysis
aws discovery start-export-task \
  --export-data-format CSV \
  --filters name=AgentId,values=agent-12345,condition=EQUALS
```

**Phase 2: Network Traffic Analysis (Week 2-3)**

This is where the real magic happens. Static inventory tells you what exists; network analysis reveals how systems actually communicate.

```bash
# Capture network flows for dependency mapping
aws discovery describe-configuration-items \
  --configuration-ids $(aws discovery list-configurations \
    --configuration-type Server \
    --query 'Configurations[].ConfigurationId' \
    --output text)

# Analyze connection patterns
aws discovery list-server-neighbors \
  --configuration-id "server-config-12345" \
  --neighbor-configuration-ids "server-config-67890"
```

**Phase 3: Application Performance Baseline (Week 3-4)**

```bash
# Deploy CloudWatch agents for detailed metrics
aws ssm send-command \
  --document-name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" \
  --parameters 'action=Install,name=AmazonCloudWatchAgent' \
  --targets "Key=tag:Environment,Values=Production"

# Configure custom metrics for application performance
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /migration/performance-baseline
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name "HighCPUBaseline" \
  --alarm-description "Track CPU patterns for sizing" \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --statistic Average \
  --period 300 \
  --evaluation-periods 2 \
  --threshold 80.0 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold
```

**The Discovery Data That Actually Matters:**

From hundreds of assessments, here's what I always focus on:


| **Critical Data Point** | **Why It Matters** | **How I Collect It** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **CPU/Memory Utilization Patterns** | Right-sizing decisions can save 40-60% of compute costs | CloudWatch, Datadog, or native monitoring |
| **Network Communication Patterns** | Dependency mapping prevents outages | Network flow analysis, application tracing |
| **Storage I/O Patterns** | Storage type selection (gp3 vs io2) affects performance and cost | OS-level monitoring, storage analytics |
| **Application Response Times** | Performance baseline for migration validation | APM tools, synthetic monitoring |
| **Backup and Recovery Requirements** | DR strategy and RTO/RPO planning | Current backup logs, business interviews |

### Comprehensive Assessment: The 7 Rs Decision Framework

Once I have the technical inventory, the real work begins: determining the optimal migration strategy for each workload. This isn't just technical analysis—it's business strategy disguised as IT architecture.

**My 7 Rs Decision Matrix:**

I've refined this matrix through countless strategy sessions where business stakeholders and technical teams needed to align on complex trade-offs.

```python
# Sample decision logic I use in Python for large portfolios
def determine_migration_strategy(app_data):
    score = {
        'retire': 0, 'retain': 0, 'rehost': 0, 'relocate': 0,
        'replatform': 0, 'repurchase': 0, 'refactor': 0
    }
    
    # Business criticality scoring
    if app_data['business_criticality'] == 'low':
        if app_data['usage_last_90_days'] < 10:
            score['retire'] += 50
        else:
            score['repurchase'] += 30
    
    # Technical complexity analysis
    if app_data['technology_age'] > 10:
        if app_data['replacement_available']:
            score['repurchase'] += 40
        else:
            score['refactor'] += 30
    
    # Compliance and regulatory factors
    if app_data['compliance_requirements'] == 'high':
        if app_data['cloud_compliance_certified']:
            score['replatform'] += 20
        else:
            score['retain'] += 40
    
    # Resource and timeline constraints
    if app_data['migration_timeline'] < 6:  # months
        score['rehost'] += 30
        score['relocate'] += 25
    
    return max(score, key=score.get)
```

**Real-World Assessment Example:**

Let me walk you through how I assessed a complex ERP system for a manufacturing client:

**Application:** Custom Manufacturing Resource Planning System

- **Technology:** .NET Framework 3.5, SQL Server 2012
- **Business Criticality:** High (revenue-generating)
- **Usage:** 200+ daily users
- **Compliance:** SOX financial reporting requirements
- **Technical Debt:** High (unsupported framework)
- **Integration Points:** 12 external systems

**Assessment Process:**

1. **Business Impact Analysis:** Interviewed 15 stakeholders across operations, finance, and IT
2. **Technical Architecture Review:** Documented all 47 integration points
3. **Performance Baseline:** 30 days of detailed metrics collection
4. **Risk Assessment:** Identified 8 high-risk dependencies
5. **Cost Analysis:** Current TCO vs. migration options

**Decision Matrix Results:**

- **Retire:** 0% (business-critical)
- **Retain:** 20% (compliance complexity)
- **Rehost:** 15% (technical debt issues)
- **Relocate:** 5% (doesn't solve technical debt)
- **Replatform:** 35% (modernize database, keep application)
- **Repurchase:** 15% (SAP available but expensive)
- **Refactor:** 60% (long-term strategic value)

**Final Recommendation:** **Refactor** with phased approach—modernize to .NET 6, containerize with ECS, migrate to Aurora PostgreSQL, implement event-driven architecture for integrations.

### Identifying Dependencies and Performance Requirements

**The Dependency Mapping Challenge**

Dependencies are the silent killers of migration projects. I've seen more migrations fail due to unexpected dependencies than any other single factor.

**My Three-Layer Dependency Analysis:**

**Layer 1: Infrastructure Dependencies**

```bash
# Network dependency discovery
aws discovery describe-configuration-items \
  --configuration-ids "config-12345" \
  --query 'ConfigurationItems[0].Relationships'

# Database connection analysis
aws discovery list-server-neighbors \
  --configuration-id "server-db-12345" \
  --max-results 100
```

**Layer 2: Application Dependencies**

```bash
# Application performance insights
aws application-insights create-application \
  --resource-group-name "migration-assessment" \
  --ops-center-enabled \
  --cwe-monitor-enabled

# Custom dependency tracking
aws xray put-trace-segments \
  --trace-segment-documents file://dependency-trace.json
```

**Layer 3: Business Process Dependencies**
This is where automated tools fail and human intelligence becomes critical. I always conduct dependency interviews with business stakeholders.

**Dependency Interview Template I Use:**

```yaml
Application: CustomerPortal
Business_Owner: Sales_Director
Technical_Owner: DevOps_Manager

Dependencies_Discovered:
  - System: PaymentProcessor
    Type: API_Integration
    Frequency: Real-time
    Criticality: High
    Failure_Impact: Revenue_loss
  
  - System: InventoryDatabase
    Type: Database_Connection
    Frequency: Every_5_minutes
    Criticality: Medium
    Failure_Impact: Stale_data

Business_Process_Dependencies:
  - Order_fulfillment_workflow
  - Customer_support_ticketing
  - Monthly_reporting_cycle

Peak_Usage_Patterns:
  - Black_Friday: 10x_normal_traffic
  - End_of_quarter: 3x_normal_reports
  - Business_hours: 80%_of_daily_load
```

**Performance Requirements: Beyond Average CPU**

Most organizations focus on average utilization, but migration success depends on understanding performance patterns, not just averages.

**Key Performance Metrics I Always Collect:**

```bash
# Application response time monitoring
aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
  --namespace "Migration/Assessment" \
  --metric-data MetricName=ResponseTime,Value=250,Unit=Milliseconds

# Database performance baseline
aws rds describe-db-log-files \
  --db-instance-identifier production-db \
  --filename-contains slowquery

# Storage I/O patterns
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/EBS \
  --metric-name VolumeReadOps \
  --dimensions Name=VolumeId,Value=vol-12345 \
  --start-time 2025-08-01T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2025-09-01T00:00:00Z \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Maximum,Average
```


### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

**The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About**

TCO analysis is where most assessments go wrong. Organizations focus on obvious costs (servers, licensing) while ignoring the hidden expenses that often represent 60% of total ownership costs.

**My Complete TCO Framework:**

**Direct Infrastructure Costs (40% of TCO):**

- Server hardware and virtualization licensing
- Storage systems and backup infrastructure
- Network equipment and connectivity
- Power, cooling, and data center space

**Operational Costs (35% of TCO):**

- IT staff time for maintenance and support
- Monitoring and management tools
- Security tools and compliance auditing
- Disaster recovery and business continuity

**Hidden Costs (25% of TCO):**

- Opportunity cost of delayed projects
- Risk costs from security vulnerabilities
- Compliance penalties and audit costs
- Technical debt interest (slower feature velocity)

**Real TCO Analysis Example:**

Here's the actual analysis I did for a financial services client migrating their trading platform:

**Current On-Premises TCO (3-Year):**

```yaml
Infrastructure_Costs:
  Servers: $450,000
  Storage: $180,000
  Network: $90,000
  Data_Center: $270,000
  Total: $990,000

Operational_Costs:
  Staff_Time: $540,000  # 2 FTE @ $90k + overhead
  Software_Licenses: $240,000
  Support_Contracts: $120,000
  Total: $900,000

Hidden_Costs:
  Security_Tools: $180,000
  Compliance_Audits: $90,000
  Downtime_Risk: $360,000  # 99.5% availability
  Opportunity_Cost: $720,000  # Delayed features
  Total: $1,350,000

Total_3_Year_TCO: $3,240,000
```

**Projected AWS TCO (3-Year):**

```yaml
Infrastructure_Costs:
  EC2_Instances: $320,000  # Right-sized with RIs
  RDS_Databases: $180,000
  Storage_EBS_S3: $90,000
  Network_Data_Transfer: $45,000
  Total: $635,000

Operational_Costs:
  Managed_Services: $270,000  # RDS, ALB, etc.
  Monitoring_CloudWatch: $36,000
  Staff_Time_Reduction: $270,000  # 1 FTE saved
  Total: $576,000

New_Capabilities:
  Advanced_Analytics: $180,000
  ML_Services: $90,000
  Enhanced_Security: $45,000
  Total: $315,000

Total_3_Year_TCO: $1,526,000
Net_Savings: $1,714,000 (53% reduction)
```

**TCO Analysis Tools and Commands:**

```bash
# AWS Pricing Calculator API for accurate estimates
aws pricing get-products \
  --service-code AmazonEC2 \
  --filters Type=TERM_MATCH,Field=instanceType,Value=m5.xlarge \
  --query 'PriceList[0]' > pricing-data.json

# Migration Evaluator for comprehensive TCO analysis
aws migrationhub-strategy get-portfolio-summary
aws migrationhub-strategy list-application-components \
  --application-id app-12345

# Cost optimization recommendations
aws compute-optimizer get-ec2-instance-recommendations \
  --instance-arns arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/i-12345
```


### Risk Assessment and Security Evaluation

**The Risks That Keep Me Up at Night**

Security isn't just a checkbox in migration assessment—it's the lens through which I evaluate every decision. One security misconfiguration can cost more than the entire migration budget.

**My Security Assessment Framework:**

**Current State Security Analysis:**

```bash
# Security configuration assessment
aws config get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule
aws inspector create-assessment-run \
  --assessment-template-arn arn:aws:inspector:region:account:target/template

# Network security evaluation
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --query 'SecurityGroups[?IpPermissions[?IpRanges[?CidrIp==`0.0.0.0/0`]]]'

# IAM policy analysis
aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
  --arn arn:aws:iam::account:user/username
```

**Migration Security Risks I Always Evaluate:**


| **Risk Category** | **Assessment Questions** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Data in Transit** | How is data currently encrypted during transfers? | TLS 1.3, VPN, AWS PrivateLink |
| **Data at Rest** | What's the current encryption standard? | AWS KMS, envelope encryption |
| **Identity Management** | How are user permissions managed today? | AWS SSO, IAM roles, least privilege |
| **Network Security** | What network segmentation exists? | VPCs, security groups, NACLs |
| **Compliance** | What regulations apply to this workload? | AWS compliance mappings, audit trails |

**Security Risk Matrix Example:**

```yaml
Application: PatientRecordsSystem
Compliance_Requirements: [HIPAA, HITECH, SOX]
Current_Security_Posture: Medium_Risk

Identified_Risks:
  - Risk: Unencrypted_database_backups
    Likelihood: High
    Impact: Critical
    Priority: P0
    Mitigation: Enable_RDS_encryption
  
  - Risk: Overprivileged_service_accounts
    Likelihood: Medium
    Impact: High
    Priority: P1
    Mitigation: Implement_IAM_roles
  
  - Risk: Legacy_TLS_versions
    Likelihood: High
    Impact: Medium
    Priority: P1
    Mitigation: ALB_SSL_policy_update

Migration_Security_Enhancements:
  - AWS_CloudTrail_for_audit_logs
  - AWS_Config_for_compliance_monitoring
  - AWS_GuardDuty_for_threat_detection
  - AWS_Secrets_Manager_for_credential_management
```

## Migration Planning: From Analysis to Action

Assessment without planning is just expensive data collection. This is where we transform all that discovery work into actionable migration strategy.

### Defining Business Objectives and Success Criteria

**The Metrics That Actually Matter**

I've learned that technical metrics don't drive business decisions—business outcomes do. Every migration plan needs clear success criteria that resonate with both technical teams and executive sponsors.

**My Business Objectives Framework:**

**Financial Objectives:**

- **Cost Optimization:** Target 30-50% TCO reduction over 3 years
- **CapEx to OpEx:** Convert 80% of infrastructure spending to operational expenses
- **Budget Predictability:** Monthly variance less than 10%

**Operational Objectives:**

- **Reliability:** Improve uptime from current baseline to target SLA
- **Performance:** Maintain or improve application response times
- **Scalability:** Handle 3x traffic spikes without manual intervention

**Strategic Objectives:**

- **Innovation Velocity:** Reduce feature deployment cycle from months to days
- **Market Responsiveness:** Enable rapid expansion to new geographic markets
- **Competitive Advantage:** Leverage cloud-native capabilities (AI/ML, analytics)

**Real Business Case Example:**

Here's how I structured the business case for a healthcare technology company:

```yaml
Company: HealthTech_Startup
Current_Situation:
  Revenue: $50M_annually
  Growth_Rate: 150%_YoY
  Infrastructure_Spend: $2M_annually
  Technical_Staff: 12_engineers
  Time_to_Market: 6_months_average

Migration_Business_Case:
  Investment_Required: $800K
  Timeline: 8_months
  
Expected_Outcomes:
  Year_1:
    Cost_Savings: $600K
    Productivity_Gain: 30%
    New_Market_Entry: 2_regions
  
  Year_2:
    Cost_Savings: $1.2M
    Feature_Velocity: 300%_improvement
    Revenue_Impact: $5M_additional
  
  Year_3:
    Total_ROI: 450%
    Market_Expansion: 5_new_regions
    Innovation_Capabilities: AI/ML_platform

Success_Metrics:
  Technical:
    - 99.9%_uptime_SLA
    - <200ms_API_response_times
    - Zero_security_incidents
  
  Business:
    - 25%_faster_time_to_market
    - $2M_annual_cost_reduction
    - 50%_improvement_in_developer_productivity
```


### Creating Migration Patterns and Metadata Validation

**The Power of Repeatable Patterns**

After migrating hundreds of applications, I've learned that most workloads fall into predictable patterns. Creating these patterns upfront eliminates decision fatigue and ensures consistency.

**My Standard Migration Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Three-Tier Web Application**

```yaml
Pattern_Name: ThreeTierWeb
Description: Web server, application server, database
Typical_Applications: E-commerce, CRM, ERP
Migration_Strategy: Replatform
Target_Architecture:
  Web_Tier: CloudFront + ALB
  App_Tier: ECS Fargate or EC2 Auto Scaling
  Data_Tier: RDS Multi-AZ
  Caching: ElastiCache
  Storage: S3 for static assets
```

**Pattern 2: Microservices Platform**

```yaml
Pattern_Name: Microservices
Description: Container-based distributed applications
Typical_Applications: APIs, mobile backends
Migration_Strategy: Refactor
Target_Architecture:
  Container_Platform: EKS or ECS
  Service_Mesh: AWS App Mesh
  API_Gateway: Amazon API Gateway
  Message_Queue: SQS/SNS
  Monitoring: CloudWatch Container Insights
```

**Pattern 3: Data Analytics Workload**

```yaml
Pattern_Name: DataAnalytics
Description: Batch processing and analytics
Typical_Applications: Reporting, ML pipelines
Migration_Strategy: Replatform/Refactor
Target_Architecture:
  Data_Lake: S3
  Processing: EMR or Glue
  Analytics: Athena + QuickSight
  ML_Platform: SageMaker
  Orchestration: Step Functions
```

**Metadata Validation Process:**

```bash
# Validate application metadata completeness
aws application-migration validate-migration-metadata \
  --application-id app-12345 \
  --required-fields BusinessOwner,TechnicalOwner,Criticality,Dependencies

# Check migration readiness
aws migration-hub-strategy get-application-component-strategies \
  --application-component-id component-67890

# Validate compliance requirements
aws config evaluate-configuration-recorder-compliance \
  --configuration-recorder-name migration-compliance-check
```


### Selecting Appropriate Migration Strategy: The Decision Engine

**Moving Beyond Guesswork**

Strategy selection is where art meets science. I've developed a decision engine that weighs multiple factors to recommend the optimal approach for each workload.

**My Strategy Selection Algorithm:**

```python
def select_migration_strategy(application):
    weights = {
        'business_criticality': 0.25,
        'technical_complexity': 0.20,
        'compliance_requirements': 0.20,
        'timeline_constraints': 0.15,
        'budget_constraints': 0.10,
        'strategic_importance': 0.10
    }
    
    strategies = ['retire', 'retain', 'rehost', 'relocate', 'replatform', 'repurchase', 'refactor']
    scores = {strategy: 0 for strategy in strategies}
    
    # Business criticality scoring
    if application.business_criticality == 'low':
        if application.usage_frequency == 'rarely':
            scores['retire'] += 80 * weights['business_criticality']
        else:
            scores['repurchase'] += 60 * weights['business_criticality']
    elif application.business_criticality == 'high':
        scores['refactor'] += 70 * weights['business_criticality']
        scores['replatform'] += 50 * weights['business_criticality']
    
    # Technical complexity assessment
    if application.technical_debt == 'high':
        scores['refactor'] += 80 * weights['technical_complexity']
    elif application.dependencies > 10:
        scores['rehost'] += 60 * weights['technical_complexity']
    
    # Compliance requirements
    if application.compliance_level == 'strict':
        if application.cloud_compliance_certified:
            scores['replatform'] += 70 * weights['compliance_requirements']
        else:
            scores['retain'] += 90 * weights['compliance_requirements']
    
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

**Decision Matrix in Action:**

Here's how I applied this framework to a portfolio of 47 applications for a financial services client:


| **Application Type** | **Count** | **Primary Strategy** | **Secondary Strategy** | **Business Justification** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Legacy Reporting** | 8 | Retire | Repurchase | Low usage, modern alternatives available |
| **Core Banking** | 3 | Retain | Replatform | Regulatory approval pending |
| **Customer Portals** | 12 | Replatform | Refactor | Modernize to managed services |
| **Internal Tools** | 15 | Rehost | Repurchase | Quick wins, low complexity |
| **Trading Systems** | 6 | Refactor | Replatform | Performance and scalability critical |
| **Data Warehouses** | 3 | Repurchase | Refactor | SaaS solutions more cost-effective |

### Building the Business Case for Cloud Adoption

**The Executive Presentation That Actually Works**

After presenting to dozens of C-level executives, I've learned that successful business cases follow a predictable structure that addresses their primary concerns: risk, return, and competitive advantage.

**My Executive Business Case Template:**

**Slide 1: The Problem We're Solving**

- Current state pain points with quantified impact
- Competitive threats requiring rapid response
- Regulatory or compliance pressures
- Growth limitations of current infrastructure

**Slide 2: The Solution and Strategy**

- High-level migration approach (not technical details)
- Timeline with major milestones
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Change management approach

**Slide 3: Financial Impact**

```yaml
Investment_Summary:
  Total_Migration_Cost: $2.4M
  Timeline: 12_months
  Funding_Sources: [Operating_Budget, AWS_MAP_Credits, Deferred_Hardware_Refresh]

Financial_Returns:
  Year_1_Savings: $800K
  Year_2_Savings: $1.6M
  Year_3_Savings: $2.4M
  3_Year_ROI: 165%
  Break_Even_Point: Month_18

Cost_Avoidance:
  Hardware_Refresh_Deferred: $1.2M
  Data_Center_Lease_Reduction: $600K
  Staff_Augmentation_Avoided: $400K
```

**Slide 4: Strategic Benefits**

- Innovation capability acceleration
- Market expansion opportunities
- Competitive positioning improvements
- Future-proofing against technology disruption

**Slide 5: Risk Management**

- Technical risk mitigation strategies
- Business continuity during migration
- Security and compliance maintenance
- Rollback plans and contingencies

**Real Business Case Success Story:**

A manufacturing client was facing a \$3M data center refresh. Here's how I positioned the cloud migration alternative:

**Traditional Path:**

- \$3M upfront hardware investment
- 18-month procurement and deployment cycle
- Limited scalability for seasonal demand
- Continued data center lease obligations

**Cloud Migration Path:**

- \$1.2M migration investment
- 8-month migration timeline
- Elastic scalability for demand spikes
- \$800K annual data center savings

**The clincher:** Cloud migration enabled them to launch in two new international markets 12 months ahead of their original plan, generating an additional \$5M in revenue.

### TCO Analysis Calculator

```python
# Python script for TCO calculations
import json

def calculate_current_tco(infrastructure, operations, hidden_costs, years=3):
    annual_cost = infrastructure + operations + hidden_costs
    return annual_cost * years

def calculate_aws_tco(compute, storage, network, managed_services, years=3):
    annual_cost = compute + storage + network + managed_services
    return annual_cost * years

def migration_roi_analysis(current_tco, aws_tco, migration_cost):
    total_savings = current_tco - aws_tco - migration_cost
    roi_percentage = (total_savings / migration_cost) * 100
    return total_savings, roi_percentage

# Example usage
current_tco = calculate_current_tco(500000, 300000, 200000)  # $1M annually
aws_tco = calculate_aws_tco(300000, 100000, 50000, 150000)   # $600K annually
savings, roi = migration_roi_analysis(current_tco, aws_tco, 400000)
print(f"3-year savings: ${savings:,}, ROI: {roi:.1f}%")
```

The assessment phase is where migration dreams either become executable plans or expensive fantasies. Every hour you invest in thorough assessment saves days of troubleshooting during migration execution. In our next chapter, we'll take the solid foundation we've built here and transform it into a migration factory capable of moving workloads with industrial precision and minimal business disruption.

Remember: **Assessment isn't about perfection—it's about informed decision-making under uncertainty.** Get the fundamentals right, acknowledge what you don't know, and plan for the unexpected. That's the difference between migration success and costly lessons learned.
