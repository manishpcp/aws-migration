# Chapter 7: Strategic Decision Making with the 7 Rs

*The Art and Science of Migration Strategy*

Three years into my consulting career, I watched a Fortune 500 manufacturing company spend \$2.8 million refactoring a legacy inventory system—only to discover six months later that a \$50,000 annual SaaS solution could have replaced it entirely. The technical team was brilliant, the execution flawless, but the strategic decision was catastrophically wrong.

**That expensive lesson crystallized my understanding: migration strategy isn't about technical capability—it's about business judgment.**

After guiding over 400 strategic migration decisions, I've learned that the 7 Rs framework isn't a menu—it's a decision tree. Each choice unlocks different futures, carries different risks, and demands different investments. The organizations that thrive in cloud are those that master not just how to execute each strategy, but when to choose each one.

This chapter distills fifteen years of strategic decision-making into frameworks you can use to navigate the most consequential choices in your migration journey.

## When to Use Each Strategy: The Decision Architecture

### Rehost: When Speed Trumps Optimization

**The Strategic Sweet Spot:**
Rehost is your go-to when you need immediate cloud benefits without the complexity of architectural changes. It's the strategy that gets you moving while preserving options for future optimization.

**When Rehost Makes Strategic Sense:**

```yaml
Primary_Use_Cases:
  Data_Center_Exit:
    Timeline: "6-12 months to vacate facility"
    Business_Driver: "Lease expiration or cost reduction"
    Risk_Tolerance: "Low - must maintain operational continuity"
    
  Market_Expansion:
    Timeline: "Quick geographic expansion required"
    Business_Driver: "Revenue opportunity with tight launch window"
    Risk_Tolerance: "Medium - business growth justifies some risk"
    
  Disaster_Recovery:
    Timeline: "Immediate backup site needed"
    Business_Driver: "Compliance or business continuity requirements"
    Risk_Tolerance: "Low - DR site must be reliable"
    
  Proof_of_Concept:
    Timeline: "Validate cloud approach before broader migration"
    Business_Driver: "Organizational learning and skill development"
    Risk_Tolerance: "Medium - learning opportunity justifies experimentation"

Decision_Criteria:
  Technical_Factors:
    - Application_works_well_in_current_state: True
    - Dependencies_are_well_understood: True
    - Performance_requirements_are_met: True
    - Security_model_can_be_replicated: True
    
  Business_Factors:
    - Timeline_pressure_exists: True
    - Budget_is_constrained: True
    - Team_lacks_cloud_native_expertise: True
    - Risk_tolerance_is_low: True
```

**Real-World Rehost Decision Framework:**

I use this decision matrix with clients to evaluate rehost suitability:


| **Factor** | **Weight** | **Scoring (1-5)** | **Rehost Threshold** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Timeline Pressure** | 25% | 5 = Immediate need, 1 = Flexible | 4+ favors rehost |
| **Application Stability** | 20% | 5 = Rock solid, 1 = Frequent issues | 4+ favors rehost |
| **Team Cloud Skills** | 15% | 5 = Expert, 1 = Beginner | 1-2 favors rehost |
| **Dependencies** | 15% | 5 = Well documented, 1 = Unknown | 4+ favors rehost |
| **Budget Constraints** | 15% | 5 = Tight budget, 1 = Flexible | 4+ favors rehost |
| **Risk Tolerance** | 10% | 5 = Risk averse, 1 = Risk seeking | 4+ favors rehost |

**Rehost Success Story:**
A global logistics company needed to exit their primary data center in 18 months due to a lease termination. They had 200+ applications, limited cloud expertise, and zero tolerance for business disruption. We rehosted 85% of their workloads in 16 months, achieving immediate cost savings and operational resilience. Post-migration, they selectively replatformed high-value applications—but rehost gave them the foundation to transform on their timeline.

**When NOT to Rehost:**

- Applications with known performance problems (cloud won't fix fundamental issues)
- Workloads requiring significant cost optimization (rehost typically increases short-term costs)
- Applications nearing end-of-life (retire or repurchase instead)
- Highly regulated environments where cloud-native security is required


### Replatform: The Goldilocks Strategy

**The Strategic Sweet Spot:**
Replatform balances speed with optimization, giving you material cloud benefits without architectural complexity. It's the strategy for applications that work well but can work better.

### Repurchase: When Building Costs More Than Buying

**The Strategic Sweet Spot:**
Repurchase transforms technology debt into operating expenses while gaining functionality you could never build internally. It's the strategy for applications where commercial solutions have surpassed custom development.

**When Repurchase Makes Strategic Sense:**

I use this evaluation framework to identify repurchase opportunities:

```python
def evaluate_repurchase_opportunity(current_application, market_analysis):
    """
    Comprehensive evaluation of repurchase vs. maintain/modernize decision

### Balancing Business Agility with Technical Constraints

**The Strategic Balance Framework:**

The most successful migrations balance speed (business agility) with sustainability (technical excellence). This balance changes based on market conditions, competitive pressures, and organizational maturity.

```yaml
Agility_vs_Technical_Excellence_Matrix:
  High_Agility_High_Technical:
    Scenario: "Market leader with strong technical capability"
    Strategy_Preference:
      Primary: "Refactor for maximum long-term advantage"
      Secondary: "Replatform for quick wins where appropriate"
    Investment_Approach: "Higher upfront investment for sustained competitive advantage"
    Timeline: "12-24 months for comprehensive transformation"
    Example: "Tech unicorns, digital-native companies"
    
  High_Agility_Medium_Technical:
    Scenario: "Fast-growing company with developing technical skills"
    Strategy_Preference:
      Primary: "Replatform for immediate benefits"
      Secondary: "Selective refactor for competitive differentiators"
    Investment_Approach: "Balanced investment with external expertise"
    Timeline: "6-18 months with phased approach"
    Example: "Scale-up companies, digital transformers"
    
  Medium_Agility_High_Technical:
    Scenario: "Established company with strong engineering culture"
    Strategy_Preference:
      Primary: "Strategic refactor for key systems"
      Secondary: "Replatform and rehost for supporting systems"
    Investment_Approach: "Thoughtful investment in strategic applications"
    Timeline: "18-36 months with careful planning"
    Example: "Traditional tech companies, financial services"
    
  Medium_Agility_Medium_Technical:
    Scenario: "Traditional enterprise beginning cloud journey"
    Strategy_Preference:
      Primary: "Rehost to establish cloud presence"
      Secondary: "Replatform for operational efficiency"
    Investment_Approach: "Conservative investment with learning focus"
    Timeline: "12-24 months with extensive planning"
    Example: "Manufacturing, healthcare, government"

Business_Pressure_Response_Framework:
  Competitive_Threat_Response:
    High_Pressure:
      Strategy: "Rehost critical systems immediately, replatform for quick optimization"
      Timeline: "3-6 months for initial migration"
      Risk_Acceptance: "Higher technical debt acceptable for market response"
      
    Medium_Pressure:
      Strategy: "Replatform primary systems, selective refactor for differentiation"
      Timeline: "6-12 months for balanced approach"
      Risk_Acceptance: "Moderate technical debt with optimization roadmap"
      
    Low_Pressure:
      Strategy: "Optimal strategy selection without timeline compromise"
      Timeline: "12-24 months for best technical outcomes"
      Risk_Acceptance: "Minimal technical debt, focus on long-term architecture"
  
  Regulatory_Compliance_Response:
    Immediate_Compliance_Required:
      Strategy: "Rehost to compliant cloud regions immediately"
      Focus: "Security and compliance over optimization"
      Timeline: "1-3 months for compliance achievement"
      
    Compliance_Timeline_Defined:
      Strategy: "Replatform with compliance-by-design approach"
      Focus: "Operational efficiency with built-in compliance"
      Timeline: "6-12 months aligned with compliance deadlines"
      
    Proactive_Compliance_Preparation:
      Strategy: "Refactor for comprehensive compliance and future flexibility"
      Focus: "Strategic advantage through superior compliance posture"
      Timeline: "12-18 months for competitive compliance advantage"

Organizational_Maturity_Considerations:
  Cloud_Beginner:
    Recommended_Strategy_Mix: "70% rehost, 20% replatform, 10% retire"
    Learning_Focus: "Cloud operations, basic managed services"
    Success_Metrics: "Operational stability, cost baseline establishment"
    Risk_Management: "Conservative approach, extensive testing, rollback plans"
    
  Cloud_Intermediate:
    Recommended_Strategy_Mix: "40% replatform, 30% rehost, 20% refactor, 10% repurchase/retire"
    Learning_Focus: "Cloud-native services, automation, monitoring"
    Success_Metrics: "Operational efficiency, performance improvement"
    Risk_Management: "Balanced risk-taking, automated testing, gradual rollouts"
    
  Cloud_Advanced:
    Recommended_Strategy_Mix: "50% refactor, 30% replatform, 15% repurchase, 5% rehost"
    Learning_Focus: "Advanced cloud patterns, serverless, AI/ML integration"
    Success_Metrics: "Innovation velocity, competitive advantage, cost optimization"
    Risk_Management: "Informed risk-taking, comprehensive automation, rapid iteration"
```


### Cost-Benefit Analysis for Each Migration Strategy

**The Financial Decision Framework:**

Every migration strategy has different cost structures and benefit profiles. Understanding these patterns helps optimize portfolio-level financial outcomes.

```python
def comprehensive_strategy_cost_benefit_analysis(application_profile, time_horizon_years=3):
    """
    Analyze cost-benefit for each viable migration strategy
    """
    
    strategies_analysis = {}

            'operational_cost_change': 0.9,  # 10% reduction
            'performance_improvement': 1.1,  # 10% improvement
            'agility_improvement': 1.2,      # 20% improvement
            'innovation_capability': 1.0     # No change

## Battle-Tested Insights: Strategic Decision-Making Non-Negotiables

**Strategy Selection Principles:**

- No single strategy fits all applications—portfolio thinking is essential
- Business outcomes drive strategy selection, not technical preferences
- Risk tolerance varies by application criticality and organizational maturity
- Financial analysis must include both direct costs and opportunity costs

**Decision-Making Process:**

- Involve business stakeholders in strategy selection, not just technical teams
- Consider organizational capacity and change management capability
- Plan for strategy evolution—today's rehost can become tomorrow's replatform
- Document decision rationale for future strategy reviews

**Implementation Success Factors:**

- Align strategy selection with team capabilities and organizational readiness
- Build in contingency planning and rollback procedures for every strategy
- Measure success using business metrics, not just technical completion
- Learn from each migration to improve future strategy decisions

**Portfolio Management:**

- Balance risk across the portfolio—don't put all high-risk strategies in one timeline
- Sequence migrations to build organizational capability progressively
- Use early wins to build confidence for more complex migrations
- Plan resource allocation across multiple concurrent migration strategies

The 7 Rs framework provides structure, but strategic decision-making requires judgment, experience, and deep understanding of business context. The organizations that excel at cloud migration are those that master not just the technical execution of each strategy, but the art of choosing the right strategy for each unique situation.

In our final chapter, we'll explore the continuous improvement and optimization that transforms good migrations into sustained competitive advantages. Because in the cloud era, migration isn't a destination—it's the beginning of continuous transformation.

Remember: **Strategy without execution is hallucination, but execution without strategy is waste. Master both the art of decision-making and the science of implementation.**
